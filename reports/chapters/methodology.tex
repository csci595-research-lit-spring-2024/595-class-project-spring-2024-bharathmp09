\section{Dataset Overview and Data Exploration}

The MNIST dataset serves as a fundamental benchmark in the field of machine learning research, particularly in tasks related to image classification and recognition. This dataset consists of a collection of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each accompanied by its corresponding label indicating the digit it represents. Researchers widely utilize the MNIST dataset to evaluate the efficacy of various algorithms and techniques for digit recognition tasks.

The MNIST dataset comprises 70,000 grayscale images, divided into a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. Each image is a 28x28 pixel square, resulting in a total of 784 pixels per image. These pixels represent the grayscale intensity, ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white). Additionally, each image is associated with a label, providing ground truth information about the digit depicted in the image.

\subsection{Loading the Dataset} 

The MNIST dataset will be retrieved from reputable sources, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch libraries, ensuring data integrity and consistency. Both the training and testing datasets will be loaded into the research environment for further exploration.

\subsection{Visualizing Sample Images}

A random selection of sample images from the dataset will be visualized to gain insights into the characteristics of handwritten digits. These images will be displayed alongside their corresponding labels, facilitating an understanding of the dataset's content.

A histogram is plotted to visualize the distribution of digit labels within the training set. It is imperative to ensure that the dataset exhibits balanced label distributions, with a similar number of samples for each digit class.

\section{Data Preprocessing}

\subsection{Flatten the image data}

In the MNIST dataset, each image represents a handwritten digit and is initially structured as a 2-dimensional array (28x28 pixels). However, most machine learning algorithms, including neural networks, require input data to be in a flat, one-dimensional format. Flattening the image data involves reshaping each image into a single vector by stacking the rows of pixels one after another. This transformation simplifies the representation of the image data and allows us to treat each pixel as a separate feature. Flattening the data ensures compatibility with various machine learning models and facilitates efficient computation during training and prediction processes.

\subsection{Normalize the pixel values:}

The pixel values in the MNIST dataset represent the intensity of grayscale pixels ranging from 0 to 255. Normalizing the pixel values involves scaling them to a standard range, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Normalization helps in stabilizing and speeding up the training process of machine learning models. It prevents certain features from dominating others due to differences in scale, thereby improving the convergence of optimization algorithms. Moreover, normalization ensures that the model's performance is not sensitive to the absolute values of the input features, making it more robust and generalizable across different datasets.

\subsection{Split the dataset into training and testing sets:}

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets is crucial for evaluating the performance of machine learning models. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance on unseen data. Additionally, it is common practice to further split the training set into a training subset and a validation set. The training subset is used for actual model training, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and monitor the model's performance during training. This split helps prevent overfitting by providing an independent dataset for model evaluation and parameter tuning. Overall, splitting the dataset ensures that the model's performance estimates are reliable and generalizable to unseen data.


\subsection{Adding Noise to MNIST Images}

The add noise function provides a convenient way to induce varied levels of Gaussian noise into the MNIST dataset. This function takes two parameters: images, which represents the array of MNIST images, and noise level, which specifies the variance of the Gaussian noise to be added. The higher the noise level, the more intense the noise added to the images.

Internally, the function generates Gaussian noise with the specified variance and adds it to the input images. It ensures that the pixel values remain within the valid range of [0, 255] by clipping the values after adding noise.
By incorporating this function into the preprocessing pipeline, we can create augmented versions of the MNIST dataset with different levels of noise. These augmented datasets can help improve the model's performance, especially in scenarios where the input data may exhibit variability or uncertainty.
